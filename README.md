2. [Unit testing utilities (assertions etc.)](#testutil)

### In-process gorilla/mux test harness ###

The [Gorilla mux](http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/mux) package is a powerful framework for building RESTful HTTP services. However, it's not as testable as it could be. In particular, tests written for itÂ must either be written directly against the handler methods themselves, or an HTTP server must be externally brought online and configured for the test environment. The muxrunner package provides some functions to write endpoint-oriented tests that can run in a variety of different contexts, including in-process testing during development and remote testing for pre-deploy or ongoing system verification. 

(Currently, only the in-process variant is implemented. Next step: implement the remote testing function, and environment variables to detect the appropriate current context.)
